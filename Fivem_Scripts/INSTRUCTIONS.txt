MOVE THE [Radio] into the resources folder
EDIT THE ANYTHING WITH THE FALLOWING TAG: !!!(CHANGE ME)!!!


MAKE SURE YOUR COMMUNITY KEY IS THE SAME IN THE VISUAL STUDIO 2022 PROJECT SERVER FILE AND ENSURE YOU RECOMPILE AND ADD THE NEW "LuciferSystems" DLLs IN THE LR !! -- I set it to use a key for security.

THE RADIO DOSE CURRENTLY SUPPORT THE FALLOWING FRAMEWORKS WITH FULL JOB RADIO PERMS:
QBCORE
ESX

YOU CAN ADD ANY FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION YOU WANT, JUST ADD THE CALL TO GRAB THE CURRENT PLAYERS JOB AND SEND IT OFF THROUGH THE NUI REQUEST AS YOU WILL SEE!.

PLEASE DONT RESELL MY CODE, I MADE THIS SO PEOPLE COULD RECOGNIZE ME AND HAVE THE FREEDOM TO USE AND EXPAND MY RADIO SYSTEM WITH ALL AND MORE FEATURES THEN ANY RADIO SYSTEM OUT THEIR.
MY RADIO DOSNT USE TEAMSPEAK, AND TAKES A LITTLE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, ALSO NOTE I HATE COMMENTING ANYTHING SO YOU WILL RARLEY SEE ANY COMMENTS IN MY CODE.

ALL HARD CLIENT ERRORS ARE AUTOMATICALLY REPORTED IN THE DISCORD YOU CONFIGURE IN THE "config.json" FILE.
